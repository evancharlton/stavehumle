# Stavehumle

This is a tribute to the delightful [Spelling Bee] game published by the [New York Times].
It is intended to help me expand my Norwegian vocabulary, and it's also intended to just be fun.

It's [freely playable online](https://stavehumle.no/) on any modern browser.

## Running locally

```sh
npm # install the dependencies
npm run dev
```

That's it!
You should now have a server running and you should be able to navigate to <https://localhost:5173> and see the app.

## Wordlist

The wordlist is based on the ordbanks published by [Nasjonalbiblioteket].
